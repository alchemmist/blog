0. *(Premise)* The world is a unity of opposites. If there is `A`, then there is `not A` *([Law of Double Negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negation#:~:text=In%20propositional%20logic%2C%20double%20negation,is%20equivalent%20to%20A))*. If there is temporal, there is eternal; if there is changing, there is unchanging; if there is mortal, there is immortal.  
Clarification: This isn't dividing all things into two categories ("here are changing things, there are unchanging ones"). The changing and unchanging are one *([Allegory of the Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave))*.

1. Therefore, if something changes, it remains fundamentally unchanged. That is: **the changing is unchanging**.  
Our experience confirms this. The "I" today and the "I" ten years ago may share no common atoms in the body—yet it remains me.

2. Thus, a **principle of unity** exists, binding all parts into a whole. This principle shapes my body over time while being independent of it. Consequently, it exists beyond time.

3. This principle of unity—the unchanging core—is best called "**meaning**" *([meaning as a phenomenon's essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(philosophy))*. Meaning cannot be destroyed or altered. Even destroying an object while declaring *"we destroyed it"* confirms its meaning persists—otherwise, what are we discussing?

Summary of aspects in every thing:  
1. **Unity as such** – the world's unity.  
2. **Unchanging** – substance, essence, being, ideal, meaning.  
3. **Changing** – mode, manifestation, accidents, phenomenon, existence, real, matter.  
4. **Unity of unchanging and changing** – the thing itself.  

Without the unchanging, we could neither think nor derive laws about the world.

The unchanging in humans is often called **soul**. The soul is:  
1. Life principle *(self-motion—contains cause of motion within itself)*.  
2. Principle of bodily form *(the aforementioned unity principle)*.  
3. Inner world, consciousness. Principle of inner psychic unity.  
4. Purpose-realizing principle.  

The soul is a synthesis of changing and unchanging: mutable through motion, yet immutable through unifying matter. This synthesis means **change within fixed limits**. Things remain themselves until exceeding their semantic boundary. *(A human crossing this boundary becomes superhuman—transcending ontology and losing original meaning, i.e., dying)*.  

*Ice example:* Molding ice preserves its "ice" meaning. Melting it into water or steam destroys "ice" but preserves "water element" meaning. Why?  
- When ice melts, its *meaning* remains unchanged—we don’t call liquid water "ice." Matter flows between meanings.  
- Matter embodies broader meanings ("water element" encompasses ice/water/steam).  

4. Ultimately, all meanings embody the universal concept of **"Being" (Сущее)**.  

This applies only to *non-living things*, indifferent to their definition—lacking subjectivity to claim meaning as *their own*. Living nature differs: the soul gathers matter into a specific form (its meaning) and *actively maintains it*. A living being cares about its definition—thus striving to preserve its form.  

Therefore, the soul—whose primary principle is eternity/immutability—seeks to manifest this principle in its material emanation.
