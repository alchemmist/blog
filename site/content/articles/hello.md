## Introduction

This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text.

Visit the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website!

This was 10 years ago, sorry for the delay :), but I thought I'll put a more actual version of the answer to help other people who just came across this question. There is a good website called google webfonts helper that helps you import your own fonts on your webserver and also gives you the css code to do it easily. If you want to import let's say the regular (400) and 500 oswald fonts, simply search for "Oswald", select regular and 500, and you get the code like this:

$$
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{y} || y) &= \sum_{c=1}^{M}\hat{y}_c \log{\frac{\hat{y}_c}{y_c}} \\
JS(\hat{y} || y) &= \frac{1}{2}(KL(y||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}) + KL(\hat{y}||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}))
\end{aligned}

### Addition

If you `want` to import let's say the regular (400) and 500 oswald fonts, simply search for "Oswald", select regular and 500, and you get the code like this:

```python
def test_foo(res: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    for i in range(1, 100):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            res.append(i)
    return res
```
