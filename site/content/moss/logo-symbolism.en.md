Symbol of this blog, which you can see on background. What it is? It’s sun – the source of the light of being. It’s solar – archetypal symbol of life energy, overabundance instead of a shortage. It’s thorns – symbol of suffering for the sake of love and transfiguration. It’s gear – the mechanism and internal structure of reality. It’s eye – door to the soul. It’s star – symbol of space, order instead of chaos. It’s mandala (मण्डल) – symbol of universe construct. It’s virus – the stricken nature. It’s crown – symbol of unhindered expression of will. It’s symbol of the church – the twelve rays, the twelve apostles at the foundation of the church. It’s a watch turned inside out – the time is illusion. It’s a flower …. #finish-this

None of this. 

For me, it’s drawing of a child.
