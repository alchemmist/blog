The symbol of this blog, which you can see in the background. What is it?  
This is the sun – the source of light of being. Solar – the archetypal symbol of life energy, its overabundance and fullness. This is the thorn – a symbol of suffering for the sake of love and transfiguration. This is the gear – the mechanism and inner structure of reality. This is the eye – the door to the soul. This is the star – a symbol of the cosmos, order instead of chaos.
This is the mandala (मण्डल) – a symbol of the structure of the universe. This is the virus, of afflicted nature. This is the crown - a symbol of unimpeded will. This is the symbol of the Church – twelve rays, twelve apostles at the foundation of the Church. This is the clock, turned inside out, for time is an illusion. This is the flower, but not in color.

For me, this is a child's drawing. Simply a child's drawing. It is drawn not for anything and not for the sake of anything. It does not reject other symbols, but gathers and envelops them from above. Nothing precedes it. Nothing issues forth from it. It is simple. It is whole; the child is not differentiated from being, it is wholly partaking of its fullness, it does not doubt, does not demand, does not seek. Therefore, its creative act in this drawing, being an expression of its inner nature, is a reflection of the nature of being.
