Integrals are found everywhere in mathematics. Let's consider the base for solving integrals. Definite integral we can solve with Newton-Leibniz formula or approximate calculate from integral definition. But for Newton-Leibniz we need to solve indefinite integral, so we will consider indefinite integral. 

Firstly, remember base integration formulas:

1. $\int a = ax + C$
2. $\int x^n = \frac{x^{n + 1}}{n + 1} + C, \ n \neq -1$
3.
