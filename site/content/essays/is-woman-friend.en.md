There are relationships between people, and they are universal, the same for both men and women. That is, the relationship between a student and a teacher is a relationship, the relationship between husband and wife is a relationship, the relationship between brother and sister is a relationship, the relationship between fellow fishermen is a relationship, and any relationship between a man and a woman is also always a relationship.

The most crucial property of a relationship is development; relationships either develop or stop at a certain stage. The ultimate goal of any relationship is building love. But not all relationships must strive for any goal, not all relationships must develop at all – this is absolutely normal.

For example, relationships with colleagues at work are a fairly superficial level, which in most cases remains at the status of "acquaintances." But every person should have a small number of truly deep relationships in their life that strive in their development toward eternity. The ultimate goal of such relationships, as already stated, is genuine, full-fledged love.

However, the development into love between a man and a woman looks different.
Same-sex relationships, firstly, have a limit in the degree of intimacy because the participants are of the same sex, and consequently, will occupy identical basic roles. At sufficiently close proximity, this naturally leads to conflicts or to the suppression (possibly quite conscious and acceptable) of the innate nature of one of the partners. Relationships between a man and a woman are capable of the maximum depth of intimacy.

Secondly, in same-sex relationships, due to the limitations stated above, development into love does not require: A – exclusivity, B – physicality. This means that I, as a man, can develop and deepen love in friendship without physical contact and without detriment to other relationships. The same is true for female friendship. But the same cannot be said for a relationship between a man and a woman. In them, love without sexuality, without intimacy, and without exclusivity is incomplete. Yet, without true friendship, without respect and care, without personal freedom – love between a man and a woman will also not be complete.

Let's try to draw a conditional boundary: unlike friendship, love between a man and a woman includes a feeling of unity and kinship not only on psychological and spiritual levels, but also on the physical, bodily level. There is attraction to each other, mutual "interweaving" into each other's life, feelings, thoughts, future plans, and memories of the past, creating a sensation of Co-Being of a scale and depth that friendly relationships cannot compare to. We can add here joint household management (the home as a reflection of love), mutual responsibility of a different quality than in friendship. Also, love between a man and a woman implies: inclusion into each other's family systems, respect for family and traditions, sexual relations as the fulfillment of love, and the birth of children as the continuation of love into the next generation. And all of this is, of course, love that includes friendship but is greater than it.

Thus, the relationship between a man and a woman is that union which can go the furthest in the degree of love, acceptance, and intimacy, combining the Greek concepts of ἔρως (eros), φιλία (philia), and ἀγάπη (agape). But such a union must begin with friendship and is not obligated to go beyond it. And in such friendship, it is necessary to set boundaries and be prepared for the fact that these relationships will find it difficult to develop fully.

>If your friend suddenly turns out<br>
Neither friend nor foe, just — so;<br>
If you cannot figure out,<br>
Whether he's good or bad, —<br>
Pull the guy up the mountain — take the risk!<br>
Don't leave him there alone:<br>
Let him be roped to you as one —<br>
There you'll learn who he is.<br>
><br>
>If the guy in the mountains ain't much,<br>
If he suddenly buckles and quits,<br>
Steps on the glacier — and slumps,<br>
Makes a misstep — and yells, —<br>
Then he's a stranger by your side,<br>
Don't you scold him — drive him away.<br>
They don't take such men up high,<br>
And they don't sing songs of such guys.<br>
><br>
>But if he didn't whine, didn't moan;<br>
Though sullen and angry, he strode,<br>
And when you fell from the cliff's height,<br>
He groaned, but he held the line;<br>
If he marched with you as to war,<br>
Stood drunk with joy on the peak, —<br>
Then on him you may rely<br>
As you would upon yourself!<br>
