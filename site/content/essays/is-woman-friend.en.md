There are relationships between people, and they are the same for everyone, both for men and for women. That is, the relationship between a student and a teacher is a relationship, the relationship between husband and wife is a relationship, the relationship between brother and sister is a relationship, the relationship between male fishermen is a relationship, and any relationship between a man and a woman is also always a relationship.

The most important property of a relationship is development; relationships either develop or stop at a certain stage. The ultimate goal of any relationship is building love. But not all relationships must strive for some goal; not all relationships must develop at all, and that is absolutely normal.

For example, relationships with colleagues at work are a fairly superficial level, which in most cases stops at the status of "acquaintances." But every person should have a small number of truly deep relationships in their life, relationships that strive toward eternity in their development. The ultimate goal of such relationships, as already stated, is genuine, full-fledged love.

However, development toward love between a man and a woman looks different.
Same-sex relationships, firstly, have a limit in the degree of intimacy because the participants are of the same sex, and consequently, will occupy identical basic roles. At a sufficiently close level, this will naturally lead to conflicts or to the suppression (potentially conscious and acceptable) of one of the partners. Relationships between a man and a woman allow for the maximum depth of intimacy.

Secondly, in same-sex relationships, due to the limitations mentioned above, development toward love does not require: A) exclusivity, B) physicality. This means that I, as a man, can develop and deepen love in friendship without physical contact and without harm to my other relationships. The same is true for female friendship. But the same cannot be said for relationships between a man and a woman. In them, love without sexuality, without intimacy, and without exclusivity is not full-fledged. Yet, without genuine friendship, without respect and care, without individual freedom – love between a man and a woman will also not be full-fledged.

Thus, the relationship between a man and a woman is that union which can go the farthest in the degree of love, acceptance, and intimacy, combining within itself the Greek concepts of ἔρως (eros), φιλία (philia), and ἀγάπη (agape). But such a union must begin with friendship and is not obligated to go beyond it. And in such a friendship, it is necessary to set boundaries and be prepared that these relationships will not be able to fully develop.

Whether he's good or bad, —
Pull the guy up the mountain — take the risk!
Don't leave him there alone:
Let him be roped to you as one —
There you'll learn who he is.

>If the guy in the mountains ain't much,
If he suddenly buckles and quits,
Steps on the glacier — and slumps,
Makes a misstep — and yells, —
Then he's a stranger by your side,
Don't you scold him — drive him away.
They don't take such men up high,
And they don't sing songs of such guys.

>But if he didn't whine, didn't moan;
Though sullen and angry, he strode,
And when you fell from the cliff's height,
He groaned, but he held the line;
If he marched with you as to war,
Stood drunk with joy on the peak, —
Then on him you may rely
As you would upon yourself!
